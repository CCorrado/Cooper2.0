## Mr. Cooper ReactJS Frontend

## Getting Started
The frontend of this application is built in ReactJS. You may develop for this frontend by using NPM and the React Dev Server.

### Running the app locally
- Note: See the top level readme regarding the .env file configuration. It is required for making network calls to the backend.

- In this directory, run:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run start`

Once these two commands have finished, the react app will be available via `http://localhost:3000/`


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
